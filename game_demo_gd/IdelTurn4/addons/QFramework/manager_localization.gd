# provides the ability to localise the game. 
# Game Framework not only supports the localisation of texts, 
# but also assets of all kinds. 
# For example, 
# a firework effect in the game can be localised as various versions, 
# so that the player will see a "新年好" 
# - like effect in the Chinese version, 
# while "Happy New Year" - like in the English version
